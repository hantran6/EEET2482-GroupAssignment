Compiling all files, add more files as the project grow:
1. Go to project root: cd /path/to/project/root
2. Compile all files (add more folders as needed, e.g., src/auction/*.cpp): 
    g++ src/main.cpp src/system/*.cpp src/users/*.cpp -o build/AuctionApp.exe

Running the main app:
1. Go to build folder: cd build
2. ./AuctionApp.exe
